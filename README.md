- 👋 Hi, I’m @Postthisweek
- 👀 I’m interested in digital accessibility and how assistive technologies read out, access or dictate content.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and using different assistive technologies as I test web pages and applications. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some languages, AI and accessibility, and some assistive techs. 
- 📫 How to reach me is via email: postthisweek1@gmail.com
